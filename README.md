# PGx-GWAS-Review

This codebase accompanies the publication "Genome-wide Association Studies in Pharmacogenomics" (in review). 

The scripts included in this repository were used to process data from the GWAS Catalog to analyze statistics regarding genome-wide association studies of pharmacogenomic phenotypes.

`Notebook.Rmd` contains all code needed to recreate the figures in the publication.  The needed data is in `data.tar.gz`.

## Set up

First, unpack the data directory

```
tar -xvzf data.tar.gz
```

You can run the notebook with [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).  The code was written using R 4.1.0.
